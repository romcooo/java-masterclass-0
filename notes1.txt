-----1 DATATYPES
	- literals can have underscores for readability
	- type=long literals should end with an 'l' or 'L' (long longValue = 100L);
	- java converts expression results to int type (no need to recast long though) - when assigning, recast using:
		- byte newByte = (byte) (byte1 + byte2);
	- float literals end with 'f' (or 'F') and doubles with d.
		- eg. float myFloat
		- double myDouble = 5d;
	- java automatically assumes that decimals are doubles (float myFloat = 5.4 -> error (5.4 is a double)
	- double is faster than float on modern machines + math functions use it more often -> use doubles instead of floats for calculations.
	- assign unicode characters to char: char myChar = '\u00A9';
		
-----2 OPERATORS
	- % = mod
	- int += 2 -> int = int + 2;
	- java operator precedence: http://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~guvenir/courses/CS101/op_precedence.html

-----3 CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS
	- Switch: you can use case 1:case 2: case 3: in order to have a single 'case' for 1, 2 and 3;
	- do {} while(); -> always executes at least once
